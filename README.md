# Droid800 ported as a RetroX Add On

The original Droid800 emulator is based on the classic Atari800 emulator
Source code for Droid800 doesn't seem to be available anymore. The last reference can be found on the AtariAge forums:

To build it you need the SDL port for Android that this emulator depends on, and the RetroX libraries
